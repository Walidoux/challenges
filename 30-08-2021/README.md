# Doxing Web App ?

Stauts: Incompleted
Working Code: Idle (same issue with pollyfils using webpack in CRA)
Context:

This is when I literally started creating doxing/hacking related websites
I wasn't really conscious of what I was doing, I guess my point of focus was on UX and UI general rules like conventions that you'd need to stick to like using `rem` unit instead of `px` and defining values only for integers that are multiple of 8.
Still never had the chance the look up into that

Tha time also made me question on how react works behind the scenes because I still remember someone told me if "those weird jsx file extensions were being read by the navigator", I couldn't figure out by myself and he needed html/css/js files to modify the actual code since he was using php and that time I still hasn't made it my worst enemy but I hadn't learnt yet
