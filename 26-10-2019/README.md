- Context:

This is probably my first website, I didn't know much about positioning.

I just wanted to have animations to make the page feel more alive and dynamic.

At that time I juste started practicing and figuring things out as I had just got my first HTML/CSS certificate,
literally for free, from [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/en/)

Also took [some notes](./What%20i%20learnt.txt) that made me kinda proud of myself because of how determined I wanted to learn styling
