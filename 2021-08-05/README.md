# Real-estate landing page (Dupont)

- Context:

This was made for the customer's father which seems to be an entrepeneur.
I didn't think that it'd be worth selling to him such a cute and tiny website that I reckon nobody would want to purchase because
of how bad it looks. I mean animations make it look good, but meh honestly.

I didn't learn much from it, except from discovering Google's SDK for using google maps as an iframe.
